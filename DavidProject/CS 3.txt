Lecture 3 Von Neumann Architecture

Consider a brain made of a system of Neurons that have connection.

We can define connections between Neurons in several ways, predicating on the labeling of the neurons.

These connections can be consisted of order pairs of labels, matrices, or sums. 

And Gate, when both inputs are both 1, the output is 1
Or Gate, when the output is 1 when EITHER the first or second input is 1. In Computer Science, the "or" is inclusive: the two inputs don't produce mutually exclusive results.
